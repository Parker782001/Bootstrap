      <span class="s1">IST 256: Programming for the Web (3 credits per semester) - An introduction to fundamental Web programming concepts: Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), extensible Markup Language (XML), JavaScript, Advanced CSS3, AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript), Angular, and NodeJS.</span>

      <span class="s1">The first part of the course introduces web programming facts and concepts. Students will be required to demonstrate understanding of the course by building web pages via individual and group activities that incorporate and illustrate the facts, concepts, and procedures in the course content.  IST 256 is required and represents the introductory web programming course for the Web Administration Option of the Associate degree in Information Sciences and Technology (IST). Upon completion of the course, the IST student will be able to identify basic concepts for programming for the web, including decentralized computing and shared information, client/server/database, e-commerce, design issues, and scalability issues as demonstrated by miscellaneous tests. They will be able to utilize advanced HTML, concepts, including style sheets, dynamic content, and scripting events, as demonstrated by completed projects. The student will also understand basic concepts for databases/data warehousing/data mining, including information and the organization, database and database management system environments, the relational database model, and object-oriented database model, as demonstrated by miscellaneous tests. They will be able to identify basic concepts about XML, multimedia resources, GUI Programming Environments, Web stack, and Dreamweaver (or the current equivalent environments. They will be able to utilize current programming technologies to produce functional programming code that enhances web page capabilities.</span>

      <span class="s1">Students will be graded on course attendance, participation, quizzes, examinations, brief exercises and their project presentation (from design to implementation, including documentation). The majority of campuses offering the Associate degree in Information Sciences and Technology will have 20-30 students enrolled in the course. The course will be offered one semester each academic year.</span>
